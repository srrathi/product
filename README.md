# Product App

This project was made with Reactjs, bootstrap and emailjs.

## What it do?
It sends the email of the ordered product to the merchant, stating that this product is ordered by this person along with the person info. I've used emailjs with react for sending emails.

I know its a very basic one but its just a beginner thing and I will try to come up with something big in future by learning from it.
